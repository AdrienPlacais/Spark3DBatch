# Spark3DBatch
Python library to launch (batch) Spark3D simulations.
`SPARK3D` versions `> 2016` should be supported, but last tests were done on
`SPARK3D 2025 SP4`.

## Installation
This library needs Python 3.x.
Firstly, adapt the variables `SPARK_PATH` and `BIN_PATH` in `spark3d.py` to
your distribution.

## Usage

Two options:

1. Provide a `SPKX` file,
2. Provide a `XML` file and a field map.
   - `XML` can be generated by unzipping a `SPKX` file, allowing you to modify
   the simulation parameters with a script.
   - Field maps can be `F3E`, `DSP` or `MFE`.

## To-do

### Important
- [x] Allow for control over accelerating field instead of power
- [ ] Change how the path to SPARK3D is declared. Currently not robust at all.

### Secondary
- [x] Package test data

### Tertiary
- [ ] Complete installation instructions
- [ ] Static typing to detect allowed keys in `XML`
- [ ] CLI interface
- [ ] On `pip`
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Use `logging` instead of `printc`
- [x] Add `release.py`
