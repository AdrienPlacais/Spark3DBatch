# Spark3DBatch
Python library to launch (batch) Spark3D simulations (version 2023 SP2).

## Installation
This library needs Python 3.x.
First of all, adapt the variables `SPARK_PATH` and `BIN_PATH` in `spark3d.py` to your distribution.

## Usage
Solution 1: provide a `.spkx` file
Solution 2: provide a `.xml` file and a field map, which can be a `.f3e`, `.dsp` or `.mfe`.
`.xml` can be generated by unziping a `.spkx` file, allowing you to modify the simulation parameters with a script.
